How to Train a ML model on Edge Impulse

Steps to Train a Model on Edge Impulse
#** 1. Set up Edge Impulse Studio**
Go to Edge Impulse Studio and log in with your account.

Click Create new project and enter a name for your project. Select the relevant category (e.g., "Image Classification", "Sensor Data", etc.).

#**2. Collect Data**
Click on DATA ACQUISITION

**Option 1: Collect Data from Device**
Connect your device to your computer.

Follow the instructions on Edge Impulse Studio to stream data from the device (e.g., sensors, camera).

Collect enough data to train your model. This could involve recording sensor values, images, or sound samples depending on your project.

**Option 2: Upload Data**
If you already have data collected, you can upload it to Edge Impulse by going to the "Data Acquisition" tab and selecting Upload data. Make sure to label each sample correctly.

#**3. Label the Data**
After data collection, label the samples appropriately.

For example, in an image classification task, each image should be labeled with the correct class.

For sensor data, create distinct labels for each scenario or condition you're trying to classify.

#**4. Create a Model**
Go to the Impulse Design section in Edge Impulse Studio.

Select the type of model you'd like to train. The most common types are:

Classification models: For tasks like object detection or gesture recognition.

Regression models: For tasks like estimating a continuous variable.

Anomaly detection models: For detecting unusual behavior in sensor data.

Add processing blocks (e.g., FFT for audio, image pre-processing) and a learning block (e.g., neural network) based on your project needs.

Configure the model architecture and parameters as necessary.

#**5. Train the Model**
Once the model is set up, click Start training.

Edge Impulse will begin training the model using the data you've uploaded or streamed.

You can monitor the training progress and performance metrics (accuracy, loss, etc.) as the model trains.

#**6. Evaluate Model Performance**
After the model is trained, evaluate its performance on a test dataset that wasnâ€™t used during training.

Edge Impulse provides tools to visualize confusion matrices, accuracy curves, and other performance metrics.

#**7. Deploy the Model to Your Device**
Once satisfied with the model's performance, deploy it to your device.

In the Deployment section of Edge Impulse Studio, select your target platform (e.g., ESP32, Raspberry Pi).

Follow the instructions to download the model and necessary dependencies to your local machine.
